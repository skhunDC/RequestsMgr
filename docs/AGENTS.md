# Documentation guide

- Keep this folder focused on descriptive docs—no build or contribution gating belongs here.
- Prefer short, actionable paragraphs over policy-style rules so future editors can extend content easily.
- When describing flows, call out where data lands in Google Sheets and how authentication decisions are made.
