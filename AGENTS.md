# Guidance for Agents

This project is a lightweight supplies request system built on Google Apps Script.

## Data Model
- **Orders**: `id | ts | requester | description | qty | status | approver`
- **Catalog**: `sku | description | category | archived`

Only the fields above are stored. Pricing and budget logic are intentionally omitted.

## Roles
- Leadership Team users may submit requests and view their own history.
- Admins manage pending approvals and the catalog. Static admins are `skhun@dublincleaners.com` and `ss.sku@protonmail.com` with optional additional addresses stored in script properties.

## Conventions
- Keep code lean and mobile-first.
- Use `google.script.run` for all client â†” server communication.
- Wrap sheet mutations with `withLock_` to avoid race conditions.

## Programmatic Checks
Run ESLint before committing:
```bash
npm test
```
